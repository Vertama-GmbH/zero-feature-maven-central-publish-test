# zero-feature-maven-central-publish-test

This is for testing publishing a java package to maven central. It contains no actual features beyond the config and code which is needed to get it published to the maven central archive. The idea is to find out, and put together, the minimal code which is needed to actually publish an open source java jar/package.
